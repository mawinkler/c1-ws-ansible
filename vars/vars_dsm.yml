# As you add agents to Deep Security, they are automatically made available for download through
#   the same hostname:port as the Deep Security Manager admin interface. For Marketplace and software deployments, pass
#   this data through the 'dsm_agent_download_hostname' & 'dsm_agent_download_port' attributes.
agent_download_hostname: <DSM ADDRESS>
agent_download_port: 4119

# Deep Security agents activate on a different port than the admin interface. For Marketplace and
#    software deployments, 'dsm_agent_activation_hostname' is typically the same as 'dsm_agent_download_hostname'
#    but 'dsm_agent_activation_port' is different than 'dsm_agent_download_port'.
agent_activation_hostname: <DSM ADDRESS>
agent_activation_port: 4120
