# For multi-tenant deployments of Deep Security (such as Workload Security), every tenant/organization
#    is assigned a unique 'tenant_id' and 'token' that is only used for agent activation. You can
#    find this info from the Support/Help > Deployment Scripts menu in the Deep Security Manager. Select any agent
#    and then enable "Activate Agent automatically after installation". This places the tenant_id and 
#    token in the script the wizard is building for you.
